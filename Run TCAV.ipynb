    "1. **example images in each folder**\n",
    " * images for each concept\n",
    " * images for the class/labels of interest\n",
    " * random images that will be negative examples when learning CAVs (images that probably don't belong to any concepts)\n",
    "2. **model wrapper**: an instance of  ModelWrapper abstract class (in model.py). This tells TCAV class (tcav.py) how to communicate with your model (e.g., getting internal tensors)\n",
    "3. **act_generator**: an instance of ActivationGeneratorInterface that tells TCAV class how to load example data and how to get activations from the model\n",
